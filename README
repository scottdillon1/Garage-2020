Hi Everyone, as we get ready to head into 2020, I am slowly but surely preparing content for the 2020 Garage Series Webinar. In 2020, we will be doing one event each month from January until November. Over the course of these events, we will be building an end to end Incident Management Solution complete with several front ends, a CAP based service layer, enterprise messaging and FAAS to drive the eventing and Fiori Elements for the operational reporting. It's my goal to post all of the source code for each of the layers in this repository so that people can use/copy/try the scenario to see how they can use SAP CLoud Platform.
